I'm really happy that I managed to get up at 5:30 a.m. and get into bed at 10:00 p.m. today.

I feel proud that I have stuck to my workout schedule.

The cululative time devoted to work and study amounted to 11 hours, slightly below my target of 12 hours.

The task of PNC study might be the hardest one for me. I struggled to organize the material I have to a structured framwork because my foundation was too weak.

And once again, I need to stay focused and avoid distractions from entertainment apps like Douyu and BiliBili.
