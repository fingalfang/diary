I'm really glad that I managed to get up at 6:30 a.m. and get into bed by 11:00 p.m. today.

I dropped the ball on my training today.

The cumulative time devoted to work and study amounted to 14.5 hours, thereby significantly exceeding my set goal of 12 hours.

Too many distractions are killing my flow.
