I regret not having gotten up at 5:30 a.m. today.

I only worked for about 3.5h, mainly reflecting on past summaries. This introspection has revealed the fruits of experience and the evolution of my capabilities, marking a journey of personal growgh and enhanced understanding.

Anyway, the allotment of time for work and study today was regrettably scant. I shall do better tomorrow.
