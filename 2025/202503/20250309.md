I regret not having gotten up at 5:30 a.m. today.

The cumulative time devoted to work and study amounted to 12.5 hours, thereby exceeding the set goal of 12 hours.

I have finally finished making the second video for Miller, which holds significant meaning for both the rest of my life and Miller's life.
