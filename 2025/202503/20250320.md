I'm really glad that I managed to get up at 5:30 a.m. and get into bed by 10:00 p.m. today.

I feel proud that I have stuck to my workout schedule.

The aggregate time dedicated to work and study amounted to 13.5 hours, thereby exceeding my set goal of 12 hours. However, I found the outcomes of my work and study endeavors to be unsatisfactory.

It's not in the high school now, I have to stay focused without classmates and teachers.
