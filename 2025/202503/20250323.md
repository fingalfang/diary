I regret not having got up at 5:30 a.m. today.

The cumulative time dedicated to work and study is 11.5 hours,which is slightly below my set goal of 12 hours.

As for me, it is so difficult to stay focused without a teacher.

+ ~~PNC old framework study~~
+ ~~PNC new framework study~~
+ PNC learning material (0/3)
+ Deep learning vedio 02~08 (4/7)
