I regret not having got up at 5:30 a.m. today.

The aggregate time dedicated to work and study amounted to 3 hours, which was significantly below my set goal of 12 hours.

The main reason that I couldn't achieve my goal is because my daughter became seriously ill. I had to devote all my attention to caring for my poor little one.
