I'm really glad that I got up at 5:30 a.m. today.

The cumulative time dedicated to work and study amounted to 12.5 hours, thereby exceeding the set goal of 12 hours.

Making a video--cutting clips,adding pictures, music and subtitles--took much longer than I expected.

The total time of shadow reading amounted to about 1 hours, which is perfect!
