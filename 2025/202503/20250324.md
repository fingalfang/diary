I regret not having got up at 5:30 a.m. today.

The cumulative time devoted to work and study amounted to 8.5 hours, which is below my set goal of 12 hours.

I sent my son to school and then studied at home rather than in the library. As an optimist, I am saticfied with my performance at home this time.
