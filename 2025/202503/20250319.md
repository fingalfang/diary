I'm really happy that I managed to rise at 5:30 a.m. and get into bed by 10:00 p.m. today.

I feel proud that I have stuck to my workout schedule.

The cumulative time devoted to work and study amouted to 13 hours, thereby exceeding my set goal of 12 hours.

It is so difficult to stay consistent, especailly after you get some jobs done.
