I regret not having got up at 5:30 a.m. today.

The aggregate time dedicated to work and study amounted to 12.5 hours, thereby slightly exceeding my set goal of 12 hours.

*C++ Primer* is way harder than I expected, So I might need to cut back on other tasks this week.

> weekly tasks:
+ *MIT OpenCourseWare about self-driving(cancelled)*
+ Deep learning vedio 08~09
+ Prime C++ chapter 1~6 (2/6)
+ Preliminaries about probability theory

**tomorrow tasks:**
- Prime C++ chapter 3~4
- Preliminaries about probability theory
