I regret not having got up at 5:30 a.m. today.

I thought that I would give up the whole day because I didn't have a good start, but it turns out that I stayed focused on work and study for a long time. The aggregate time amounted to 14.5 hours. I'm so proud about that.

I'm really happy that I have a better understanding of backpropagation and gradients after my study endeavors.
