I'm really glad that I managed to rise at 5:30 a.m. and get into bed by 10:00 p.m. today.

I feel proud that I have stuck to my workout schedule today.

The aggregate time devoted to work and study amounted to 13 hours, thereby exceeding my set goal of 12 hours. I was satisfied with the outcomes of my Deep learning study which gave me a overall knowledge about dataset, learning algorithm, model and cost function and optimizers.
