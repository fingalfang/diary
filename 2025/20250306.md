I'm really glad that I got up at 5:30 a.m. today.

The aggregate time devoted to work and study amounted to 11.5 hours, slightly below the target of 12 hours. Howerver, I found the outcomes of my work and study endeavors to be unsatisfactory.

I'm gonna make shadow reading a bigger part of my English practice from now on.
