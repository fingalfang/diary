I regret not having gotten up at 5:30 a.m. today.

I decided to work and study at home rather than in the library today, which turned out to be a bad decision. I couldn't wake up at 5:30 a.m., I couldn't focus my attention on work and study, I couldn't do anything but rest at home.

However, I will try to stick to my work and study plan at home again next Monday.
