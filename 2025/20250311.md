I'm really happy that I managed to get up at 5:30 a.m. and go to bed at 10:00 p.m. today.

I feel so proud that I stuck to my workout schedule.

The cululative time dedicted to work and study amounted to 13 hours, which is perfect!

While reading the book 10 Visions for Our Future, I came across a thought-provoking quesion: Should we allow machines to make decisions that could potentially harm or even kill humans? This has given me a lot to think about.
