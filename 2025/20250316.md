I'm really happy that I managed to rise at 5:30 a.m. and get into bed by 10:00 p.m. today.

I feel proud that I have stuck to my workout schedule.

The cumulative time devoted to work and study amounts to 8.5 hours, which is far below my set goal of 12 hours.

There are something wrong with my strategy called "pig belly", so I have uninstalled Douyu app from my phone to see if it will bring about some positive changes.
