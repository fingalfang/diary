I'm really happy that I managed to get up at 5:30 a.m. and go to bed at 10:00 p.m. today.

I feel proud that I have stuck to my workout schedule.

The cumulative time dedicated to work and study amounted to 14 hours, which is almost my limit. Howerver, the results aren't so satifying as the time I put in.

When tackling complex problems, I need to stay high focused and avoid distractions from entertainment apps like Douyu and BiliBili.
