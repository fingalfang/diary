I regret not having got up at 5:30 a.m. today.

The cumulative time devoted to work and study amounted to 12 hours, thereby just hitting my set goal of 12 hours. However, I was not satisfied with the outcomes of my endeavors.

The phone is the gift and the curse. The curse is there's a high level of negativity. That's out there, that's on that shit. So when you just consumed on that shit all day, you start to see youself being part of the negative shit.
