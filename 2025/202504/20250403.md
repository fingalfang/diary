I regret not having got up at 5:30 a.m. today.

The aggregate time dedicated to work and study amounted to 12.5 hours, thereby slightly exceeding my set goal of 12 hours.

I've been struggling with *C++ Primer* recently. I feel C++ sacrifices too much usability for backward compatibility with C, forcing learners to absorb numerous fragmented concepts before they can start programming effectively in C++.
