I regret not having got up at 5:30 a.m. today.

The aggregate time dedicated to work and study amounted to 12.5 hours, thereby slightly exceeding my set goal of 12 hours.

I actually stayed focused until 4:30 p.m. without getting distracted by the internet. As for me, it's a huge progress! Many a little makes a mickle.
