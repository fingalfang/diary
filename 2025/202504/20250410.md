I was really glad that I managed to get up at 5:30 a.m. and get into bed by 10:00 p.m. today.

I feel so proud that I have stuck to my workout schedule today.

The cumulative time devoted to work and study amounted to 10.5 hours, which was slightly below my set goal of 12 hours.

I learned a lot of intersting knowledge about pitch, and finally got the music theory -- modes, semitones and absolute pitch!

At last, I must respect deadlines!
