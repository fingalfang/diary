I regret not having got up at 5:30 a.m. today.
I dropped the ball on my training today.
The aggregate time dedicted to work and study amounted to 5 hours, which was significantly below my set goal of 12 hours.
Last time I wrote weekly tasks is 7 days ago. Oh my god, It's quite a long time.There is no doubt that I've been in a slump lately.

> weekly tasks:
+ Path Overall Design study
+ Speed Overall Design study
+ Selector Overall Design study
+ Deep learning vedio 08~09
+ Prime C++ chapter 5~6 (1/2)

**tomorrow tasks:**
