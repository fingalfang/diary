I regret not having got up at 5:30 a.m. today.

The aggregate time dedicated to work and study amounted to 9.5 hours, which was below my set goal of 12 hours.

I was really struggling with deep learning study. It was tougher than I expected.

> weekly tasks:
+ Path Overall Design study
+ Speed Overall Design study
+ Selector Overall Design study
+ Deep learning vedio 08~09
+ Prime C++ chapter 5~6 (1/2)

**tomorrow tasks:**
