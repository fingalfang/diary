I regret not having got up at 5:30 a.m. today.

I dropped the ball on my training today.

The aggregate time dedicted to work and study amounted to 6.5 hours, which was significantly below my set goal of 12 hours.

There is still some moving work to do. I guess it will take about one and a half day.
