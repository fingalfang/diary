I'm really glad that I managed to get up at 5:30 a.m. and get into bed at 10:00 p.m. today.

I feel proud that I have stuck to my workout schedule.

The cumulative time dedicated to work and study amounts to 7.5 hours, which is far below my set goal of 12 hours. This once again reminded me how difficult it is to stay consistent.
