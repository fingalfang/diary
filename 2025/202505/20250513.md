I'm really glad that I managed to get up at 5:30 a.m. and get into bed by 10:00 p.m. today.

I feel proud that I have stuck to my workout schedule today.

The cumulative time devoted to work and study amounted to 15 hours, thereby hitting my set goal of 12 hours.

All my work from yesterday went down the drain because of one stupid mistake! I had to redo everything I did yesterday -- talk about a waste of time.
