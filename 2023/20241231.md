It is the last day of this year. I will try to write my diary in English from now on.

I worked for about 7.5 hours, mainly catching up on writing the weekly and monthly summaries.

It was Sunday, so I spent the rest of my time on playing with my kids.

>weekly task:
+ simple tasks: none
+ complex tasks: none
